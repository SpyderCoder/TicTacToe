# TicTacToe
A console TicTacToe game made with Java.
I made this using Java 11 though it might work with Java 8
considering I don't think I used any features that Java 8
doesn't have.

The state machine for the computer AI is still a bit buggy but that will be ironed out
in a future update along with some code clean up.
